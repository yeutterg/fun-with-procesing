Based on the tutorial [here](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Designing-Data-Visualizations-Getting-Started-with-Processing/1063775924). You may be able to sign up for a free trial to access this tutorial.

The data, found in [meteors.csv](./meteors.csv), comes from [The Meteoritical Society](https://www.lpi.usra.edu).
